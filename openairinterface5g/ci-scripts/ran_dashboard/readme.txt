The code ran_dashboard.py was initially developped to bring MR status and test resuts to a google sheet, using google sheets API.
This method is now deprecated, and replaced by Hdashboard.py that builds the results as HTML page and loads it to AWS S3.
ran_dashboard_cfg.yaml is still used by Hdashboard.py as tests config file.
